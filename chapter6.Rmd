Chapter 6: Partial pooling and likelihood
==============================

The main dish. I'd like to avoid a recipe-based approach where we discuss varying intercept and varying slope models as primary objectives. Instead, I think it's important to cover these topics as special cases of the general approach of hierarchical modeling as a means to impose probabilistic structures on parameters. From that perspective, students should be able to better extend these methods for their own work.

#### Priorities

- definition
- review previous examples
- hyperparameters (they've always been there even when we don't acknowledge them)
- varying intercepts (NBA freethrow example) with `lme4`
- partial pooling
- clearing up confusion about nestedness
- simple hierarchical models with likelihood
- continous predictors for multiple levels

#### Optional

- plotting estimates for different levels from lme4 models
