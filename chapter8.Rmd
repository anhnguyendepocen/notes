Chapter 8: Hierarchical model construction
===============================

This is where I think we will have the greatest impact on students future work. Translating problems to models is a key skill, and it may take a fair bit of practice. Tools to implement include graphical skills (e.g. drawing DAGs), and familiarity with probability distributions.

- parameter, process, and observation models
- building complexity from simple pieces
- translating biological problems and observations to models
- example: what method works best for detecting a species?
- example: error in variables models
- more practice in developing models (don't necessarily have to implement)
