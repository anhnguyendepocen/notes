Chapter 3: Fitting Bayesian linear models
==============================

#### Priorities

- Bayes' theorem and Bayesian probability
- relationsihp between likelihood and Bayesian inference
- priors (generally, informative vs. non-informative)
- interpreting posterior disributions (mean, mode, intervals)
- intro to Bayesian computation and MCMC
- single parameter models: MLE vs. Bayesian treatments
- Bayesian linear regression: intro to Stan & JAGS

#### Optional

- comparing posterior distributions for different parameter estimates (i.e. are they "significantly" different)
- proper vs. improper priors
